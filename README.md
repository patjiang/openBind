# openBind
Open Source Code for ASU iGEM 2024 De Novo Design Project


This Repository serves as a series of Colaboratory Notebooks; feel free to tinker the code depending on the amount of compute resources you have available.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
To use any of the batchscripts/jupyter notebook codes, please follow the following steps listed below:

#TODO - Conda Env installation, Hardware Requirements
#TODO - Conda Package Management

#TODO - Comparison of runtimes for generating 64 binders
  - Define out for each approach - Minimal Computation colaboratory, Maximal Computation colaboratory, batchscripts, Jupyter Notebook
  - For Minimal Computation, use T4 gpu only, in Maximal Computation, batchscripts, Jupyter Notebook, use A100_80 GPU's
#TODO - Comparison of CHE (Core-Hour Equivalents) as well as market price computation costs


TODO:
- Create script that will automate length of binder to generate
- Adapt GeneratingBackbonesandAAseqs.ipynb to a jupyter instance or even just a .py instance
- Adapt DynamicBind/GAABind from jupyter/htc over to colaboratory instances.
