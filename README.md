# openBind
Open Source Code for ASU iGEM 2024 De Novo Design Project


This Repository serves as a series of Colaboratory Notebooks; feel free to tinker the code depending on the amount of compute resources you have available.


TODO:
- Create script that will automate length of binder to generate
- Adapt GeneratingBackbonesandAAseqs.ipynb to a jupyter instance or even just a .py instance
- Adapt DynamicBind/GAABind from jupyter/htc over to colaboratory instances.
