## Compute Testing Folder

The scripts and the code in these folders contain the various scripts I used to test computational accessibility of the methods I present.
You may use these, but I would recommend the scripts in the ```generate``` and ```bind``` folders instead, as they are more user-friendly 
and require less reading of poorly annotated code.
